= Compile skulls3d =

You need:
 * The [http://www.libsdl.org/ SDL], as of 2010-02, the latest development version is 1.2.14-VC8 ([http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.14-VC8.zip download]).
 * [http://code.google.com/p/swegl/ swegl], the 3D software renderer.


Once downloaded the source tree should look like this:
{{{
mycodefolder/skulls3d/DOOM.WAD
                     /SDL.lib
                     /Src/main.cpp
                         /...
                     /Projects/VC 2008/skulls3d.sln
                                      /...
                     /Projects/VCE 2005/skulls3d.sln
                                       /...
            /swegl/Projects/VC 2008/swegl.sln
                                   /...
                           /VCE 2005/swegl.sln
                                    /...
                  /Src/DataClasses
                      /...
}}}

You now need to change a user preference in the project. Open skulls3d.sln right-click on the project, open the properties box. Select the configuration "All configurations". Now select Configuration Properties > Debugging. As Working Directory, set "$(ProjectDir)\..\..\" without the quotes. This way, when debugging or running from visual studio, the program runs in the root folder of the project, thus having access to doom.wad and sdl.dll.

Now press F5 and hope for the best.
